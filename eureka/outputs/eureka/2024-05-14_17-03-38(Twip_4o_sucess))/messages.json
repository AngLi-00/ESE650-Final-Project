        "content": "Certainly! To control the joints of the two-wheeled inverted pendulum robot to maintain its balance, move it towards a target position, and minimize pitch and yaw oscillations, we need to design a reward function that encourages the robot to achieve these objectives.\n\nSince the observation vector contains:\n- `obs_buf[:, 0]`: x velocity (x_d)\n- `obs_buf[:, 1]`: y velocity (y_d)\n- `obs_buf[:, 2]`: pitch angle\n- `obs_buf[:, 3]`: pitch angular velocity (pitch_d)\n- `obs_buf[:, 4]`: yaw angular velocity (yaw_d)\n\nWe will create a reward function that:\n1. Rewards the agent for minimizing the distance to the target.\n2. Penalizes high pitch angles and angular velocities.\n3. Penalizes high yaw angular velocities.\n\nHere is the reward function:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom typing import Dict, Tuple\n\n@torch.jit.script\ndef compute_reward(obs_buf: torch.Tensor, goal_pos: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:\n    # Extract observation values\n    x_d = obs_buf[:, 0]  # x velocity\n    y_d = obs_buf[:, 1]  # y velocity\n    pitch = obs_buf[:, 2]  # pitch angle\n    pitch_d = obs_buf[:, 3]  # pitch angular velocity\n    yaw_d = obs_buf[:, 4]  # yaw angular velocity\n    \n    # Calculate distance to the target position\n    distance_to_target = torch.sqrt((goal_pos[0] - x_d)**2 + (goal_pos[1] - y_d)**2)\n    \n    # Rewards and penalties\n    distance_reward = -distance_to_target\n    pitch_penalty = -torch.abs(pitch)\n    pitch_d_penalty = -torch.abs(pitch_d)\n    yaw_d_penalty = -torch.abs(yaw_d)\n    \n    # Temperature parameters for normalization\n    temp_distance = torch.tensor(1.0, device=obs_buf.device)\n    temp_pitch = torch.tensor(1.0, device=obs_buf.device)\n    temp_pitch_d = torch.tensor(1.0, device=obs_buf.device)\n    temp_yaw_d = torch.tensor(1.0, device=obs_buf.device)\n    \n    # Apply temperature normalization (optional)\n    distance_reward = torch.exp(distance_reward / temp_distance)\n    pitch_penalty = torch.exp(pitch_penalty / temp_pitch)\n    pitch_d_penalty = torch.exp(pitch_d_penalty / temp_pitch_d)\n    yaw_d_penalty = torch.exp(yaw_d_penalty / temp_yaw_d)\n    \n    # Total reward\n    total_reward = distance_reward + pitch_penalty + pitch_d_penalty + yaw_d_penalty\n    \n    # Individual reward components for analysis\n    reward_components = {\n        \"distance_reward\": distance_reward,\n        \"pitch_penalty\": pitch_penalty,\n        \"pitch_d_penalty\": pitch_d_penalty,\n        \"yaw_d_penalty\": yaw_d_penalty\n    }\n    \n    return total_reward, reward_components\n```\n\nExplanation:\n1. **distance_to_target** measures how far the robot is from its target position.\n2. **distance_reward** provides a negative value proportional to the distance, encouraging the robot to reduce it.\n3. **pitch_penalty**, **pitch_d_penalty**, and **yaw_d_penalty** penalize the system for high pitch angles, pitch angular velocities, and yaw angular velocities respectively.\n4. Each component is optionally normalized using `torch.exp` to help scale the reward.\n5. The total reward is the sum of these components.\n6. A dictionary of each individual component is returned for analysis.\n\nThis reward function aims to maintain the robot\u2019s balance while moving it towards the target position, minimizing undesirable oscillations."
