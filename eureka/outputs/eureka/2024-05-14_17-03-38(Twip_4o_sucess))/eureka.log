Certainly! To control the joints of the two-wheeled inverted pendulum robot to maintain its balance, move it towards a target position, and minimize pitch and yaw oscillations, we need to design a reward function that encourages the robot to achieve these objectives.

Since the observation vector contains:
- `obs_buf[:, 0]`: x velocity (x_d)
- `obs_buf[:, 1]`: y velocity (y_d)
- `obs_buf[:, 2]`: pitch angle
- `obs_buf[:, 3]`: pitch angular velocity (pitch_d)
- `obs_buf[:, 4]`: yaw angular velocity (yaw_d)

We will create a reward function that:
1. Rewards the agent for minimizing the distance to the target.
2. Penalizes high pitch angles and angular velocities.
3. Penalizes high yaw angular velocities.

Here is the reward function:

```python
import torch
from typing import Dict, Tuple

@torch.jit.script
def compute_reward(obs_buf: torch.Tensor, goal_pos: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:
    # Extract observation values
    x_d = obs_buf[:, 0]  # x velocity
    y_d = obs_buf[:, 1]  # y velocity
    pitch = obs_buf[:, 2]  # pitch angle
    pitch_d = obs_buf[:, 3]  # pitch angular velocity
    yaw_d = obs_buf[:, 4]  # yaw angular velocity
    
    # Calculate distance to the target position
    distance_to_target = torch.sqrt((goal_pos[0] - x_d)**2 + (goal_pos[1] - y_d)**2)
    
    # Rewards and penalties
    distance_reward = -distance_to_target
    pitch_penalty = -torch.abs(pitch)
    pitch_d_penalty = -torch.abs(pitch_d)
    yaw_d_penalty = -torch.abs(yaw_d)
    
    # Temperature parameters for normalization
    temp_distance = torch.tensor(1.0, device=obs_buf.device)
    temp_pitch = torch.tensor(1.0, device=obs_buf.device)
    temp_pitch_d = torch.tensor(1.0, device=obs_buf.device)
    temp_yaw_d = torch.tensor(1.0, device=obs_buf.device)
    
    # Apply temperature normalization (optional)
    distance_reward = torch.exp(distance_reward / temp_distance)
    pitch_penalty = torch.exp(pitch_penalty / temp_pitch)
    pitch_d_penalty = torch.exp(pitch_d_penalty / temp_pitch_d)
    yaw_d_penalty = torch.exp(yaw_d_penalty / temp_yaw_d)
    
    # Total reward
    total_reward = distance_reward + pitch_penalty + pitch_d_penalty + yaw_d_penalty
    
    # Individual reward components for analysis
    reward_components = {
        "distance_reward": distance_reward,
        "pitch_penalty": pitch_penalty,
        "pitch_d_penalty": pitch_d_penalty,
        "yaw_d_penalty": yaw_d_penalty
    }
    
    return total_reward, reward_components
```

Explanation:
1. **distance_to_target** measures how far the robot is from its target position.
2. **distance_reward** provides a negative value proportional to the distance, encouraging the robot to reduce it.
3. **pitch_penalty**, **pitch_d_penalty**, and **yaw_d_penalty** penalize the system for high pitch angles, pitch angular velocities, and yaw angular velocities respectively.
4. Each component is optionally normalized using `torch.exp` to help scale the reward.
5. The total reward is the sum of these components.
6. A dictionary of each individual component is returned for analysis.

This reward function aims to maintain the robotâ€™s balance while moving it towards the target position, minimizing undesirable oscillations.

. Please fix the bug and provide a new, improved reward function!
The output of the reward function should consist of two items:
    (1) the total reward,
    (2) a dictionary of each individual reward component.
The code output should be formatted as a python code string: "```python ... ```".

Some helpful tips for writing the reward function code:
    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components
    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable
    (3) Make sure the type of each input variable is correctly specified; a float input variable should not be specified as torch.Tensor
    (4) Most importantly, the reward code's input variables must contain only attributes of the provided environment class definition (namely, variables that have prefix self.). Under no circumstance can you introduce new input variables.
