        "content": "To accomplish the task of controlling the joints of a two-wheeled inverted pendulum robot to maintain balance, move to a target position, and minimize pitch and yaw oscillations, we can break down the reward function to penalize unwanted movements and reward goal-oriented actions. \n\nThe reward function should take into account the following factors:\n1. Distance to the target position (`x_d` and `y_d` from `self.obs_buf`).\n2. Pitch angle and its rate (`pitch` and `pitch_d` from `self.obs_buf`).\n3. Yaw rate (`yaw_d` from `self.obs_buf`).\n\nHere's how the reward function can be structured:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom typing import Tuple, Dict\n\n@torch.jit.script\ndef compute_reward(\n    obs_buf: torch.Tensor,\n    root_states: torch.Tensor,\n) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:\n    \n    # Extract relevant information from observations\n    x_d = obs_buf[:, 0]               # Distance in x direction to target\n    y_d = obs_buf[:, 1]               # Distance in y direction to target\n    pitch = obs_buf[:, 2]             # Pitch angle\n    pitch_d = obs_buf[:, 3]           # Pitch rate\n    yaw_d = obs_buf[:, 4]             # Yaw rate\n    \n    # Define positive and negative weights for different objectives\n    position_reward_weight = 1.0\n    balance_reward_weight = 1.0\n    control_effort_weight = 0.1\n    \n    # Compute distance to target positions reward (Euclidean distance)\n    distance_to_target = torch.sqrt(x_d**2 + y_d**2)\n    target_position_reward = - distance_to_target * position_reward_weight\n    \n    # Compute balance-related rewards (keeping pitch and yaw small)\n    balance_penalty = (torch.abs(pitch) + torch.abs(pitch_d) + torch.abs(yaw_d)) * balance_reward_weight\n    \n    # Add small penalty for control effort (to encourage stability)\n    control_effort_penalty = (torch.abs(pitch_d) + torch.abs(yaw_d)) * control_effort_weight\n    \n    # Combine the rewards and penalties\n    total_reward = target_position_reward - balance_penalty - control_effort_penalty\n    \n    # Optionally transform the reward component for better convergence (normalize via exponential)\n    temperature = 1.0  # You can tune this parameter\n    transformed_total_reward = torch.exp(total_reward / temperature)\n    \n    reward_components = {\n        \"target_position_reward\": target_position_reward,\n        \"balance_penalty\": balance_penalty,\n        \"control_effort_penalty\": control_effort_penalty,\n        \"transformed_total_reward\": transformed_total_reward\n    }\n    \n    return transformed_total_reward, reward_components\n\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Target Position Reward**: This reward encourages the agent to minimize the Euclidean distance to the target position, promoting movement towards the target.\n2. **Balance Penalty**: This penalty discourages large pitch angles, pitch rates, and yaw rates, thereby promoting balance.\n3. **Control Effort Penalty**: This small penalty for control effort encourages smoother movements and can help the agent avoid oscillations and instability.\n\n### Note:\n- This reward function assumes that all input tensors (e.g., `obs_buf`) are on the same device.\n- The `temperature` parameter controls the normalization and scaling of the exponential transform.\n- The weights can be tuned to ensure the agent prioritizes the objectives appropriately during training.\n\nThis reward function, combined with the existing observations, should help train an agent to balance the robot while moving towards the target and minimizing oscillations."
