To accomplish the task of controlling the joints of a two-wheeled inverted pendulum robot to maintain balance, move to a target position, and minimize pitch and yaw oscillations, we can break down the reward function to penalize unwanted movements and reward goal-oriented actions. 

The reward function should take into account the following factors:
1. Distance to the target position (`x_d` and `y_d` from `self.obs_buf`).
2. Pitch angle and its rate (`pitch` and `pitch_d` from `self.obs_buf`).
3. Yaw rate (`yaw_d` from `self.obs_buf`).

Here's how the reward function can be structured:

```python
import torch
from typing import Tuple, Dict

@torch.jit.script
def compute_reward(
    obs_buf: torch.Tensor,
    root_states: torch.Tensor,
) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:
    
    # Extract relevant information from observations
    x_d = obs_buf[:, 0]               # Distance in x direction to target
    y_d = obs_buf[:, 1]               # Distance in y direction to target
    pitch = obs_buf[:, 2]             # Pitch angle
    pitch_d = obs_buf[:, 3]           # Pitch rate
    yaw_d = obs_buf[:, 4]             # Yaw rate
    
    # Define positive and negative weights for different objectives
    position_reward_weight = 1.0
    balance_reward_weight = 1.0
    control_effort_weight = 0.1
    
    # Compute distance to target positions reward (Euclidean distance)
    distance_to_target = torch.sqrt(x_d**2 + y_d**2)
    target_position_reward = - distance_to_target * position_reward_weight
    
    # Compute balance-related rewards (keeping pitch and yaw small)
    balance_penalty = (torch.abs(pitch) + torch.abs(pitch_d) + torch.abs(yaw_d)) * balance_reward_weight
    
    # Add small penalty for control effort (to encourage stability)
    control_effort_penalty = (torch.abs(pitch_d) + torch.abs(yaw_d)) * control_effort_weight
    
    # Combine the rewards and penalties
    total_reward = target_position_reward - balance_penalty - control_effort_penalty
    
    # Optionally transform the reward component for better convergence (normalize via exponential)
    temperature = 1.0  # You can tune this parameter
    transformed_total_reward = torch.exp(total_reward / temperature)
    
    reward_components = {
        "target_position_reward": target_position_reward,
        "balance_penalty": balance_penalty,
        "control_effort_penalty": control_effort_penalty,
        "transformed_total_reward": transformed_total_reward
    }
    
    return transformed_total_reward, reward_components

```

### Explanation:
1. **Target Position Reward**: This reward encourages the agent to minimize the Euclidean distance to the target position, promoting movement towards the target.
2. **Balance Penalty**: This penalty discourages large pitch angles, pitch rates, and yaw rates, thereby promoting balance.
3. **Control Effort Penalty**: This small penalty for control effort encourages smoother movements and can help the agent avoid oscillations and instability.

### Note:
- This reward function assumes that all input tensors (e.g., `obs_buf`) are on the same device.
- The `temperature` parameter controls the normalization and scaling of the exponential transform.
- The weights can be tuned to ensure the agent prioritizes the objectives appropriately during training.

This reward function, combined with the existing observations, should help train an agent to balance the robot while moving towards the target and minimizing oscillations.

Please carefully analyze the policy feedback and provide a new, improved reward function that can better solve the task. Some helpful tips for analyzing the policy feedback:
    (1) If the success rates are always near zero, then you must rewrite the entire reward function
    (2) If the values for a certain reward component are near identical throughout, then this means RL is not able to optimize this component as it is written. You may consider
        (a) Changing its scale or the value of its temperature parameter
        (b) Re-writing the reward component 
        (c) Discarding the reward component
    (3) If some reward components' magnitude is significantly larger, then you must re-scale its value to a proper range
Please analyze each existing reward component in the suggested manner above first, and then write the reward function code. The output of the reward function should consist of two items:
    (1) the total reward,
    (2) a dictionary of each individual reward component.
The code output should be formatted as a python code string: "```python ... ```".

Some helpful tips for writing the reward function code:
    (1) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like torch.exp to the overall reward or its components
    (2) If you choose to transform a reward component, then you must also introduce a temperature parameter inside the transformation function; this parameter must be a named variable in the reward function and it must not be an input variable. Each transformed reward component should have its own temperature variable
    (3) Make sure the type of each input variable is correctly specified; a float input variable should not be specified as torch.Tensor
    (4) Most importantly, the reward code's input variables must contain only attributes of the provided environment class definition (namely, variables that have prefix self.). Under no circumstance can you introduce new input variables.
